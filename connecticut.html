The State has no additional criteria for drawing its Congressional or Senate districts.  State House districts must be drawn so as to minimize the number of towns split across multiple districts.\
        </p>\
        <br />\
        <h4> Redistricting Process</h4> <p> Congressional and legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the decennial U.S. Census.  Connecticut uses the same process to draw both its congressional and legislative districts. The legislature, appoints an eight member, bipartisan Reapportionent Committee which draws the new maps.  If the plans pass a two-thirds vote in both houses of the legislature, they are enacted.<br />\
        If not, a nine member bipartisan Reapportionment Commission is established.  Four members are appointed by each party's leaders in the legislature and the ninth is selected by the first eight members of the Commission. The Reapportionment Commission has the power to enact districting plans with a simple majority vote.<br />\
        If the Reapportionment Commission fails to enact a plan, then the Connecticut Supreme Court can either compel the Commission to agree on a plan or draw and enact a map itself.\
        </p>\
        <br />\
        <h4> In 2011... </h4> <p>In the most recent redistricting cycle, the legislature failed to pass plans by a two-thirds majority, so a Reapportionment Commission was formed.  The Commission unanimously adopted State House and Senate plans, but failed to agree on a set of Congressional districts.  The Connecticut Supreme Court ordered the appointment of a special master to draw the Congressional districts, and his plan was enacted by the Court.\
