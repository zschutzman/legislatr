        Maine draws Senate districts.  There are 35 of them and they all have around 40,000 people.
        <br />
        This number isn't fixed. The Constitution says there must be 'an odd number of Senators, not less than 31 nor more than 35'.  Which seems like a really messy way to say 31, 33, or 35. Also, they mean "fewer", not "less".
        <br />
        The Senate districts are numbered from north to south, whereas the House districts are numbered the other direction.
