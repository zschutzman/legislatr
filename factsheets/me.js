    <h4>The Legislature </h4><p> Maine's state legislature is bicameral with a House of Representatives and a Senate.  Members of both houses are elected to two-year terms in even-numbered\
    years.  Members may serve up to four consecutive terms in a particular house.</p>\
    <p> In the current legislative session, Democrats hold 21 of the 35 Senate seats, and Republicans hold 14.  In the House, Democrats hold 89 of the 151 seats, Republicans hold 57, and Independent and third-party candidates hold 5.  Both members of the delegation to the U.S.\
    House of Representatives are Democrats.<br />\
    Three Native American communities in Maine, the Passamaquoddy Nation, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseets, are each entitled to elect a non-voting representative to the Maine State House.  While these members cannot cast floor votes, they can sponsor legislation related to Tribal issues\
    as well as serve as voting members of committees.  The Penobscot and Passamaquoddy Nations withdrew their represenative in 2015 in protest, and the Penobscot representative has yet to return to the legislature.\
    </p><br />\
    <h4> Rules and Requirements </h4><p> \
    Maine's congressional districts must comply with federal equal population and contiguity requirements as well as the Voting Rights Act. \
    The State Constitution also requires that congressional districts be contiguous and compact as well as minimally subdividing existing political units.  State legislative\
    districts must also be contiguous and compact, with the additional definition that 'contiguous and comapct' is with respect to the ease of travel within the district.  Consideration\
    is also to be given to the interests of local communities in drawing the maps, even if this requires dividing a political subunit.  If a municipality has sufficient population to draw at least one \
    district, these districts must be drawn entirely within the boundaries of that municipality.
    </p>\
    <br />\
    <h4> Redistricting Process</h4> <p> Congressional and legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the decennial U.S. Census. \
Maine uses the same process to draw both its congressional and legislative districts. The legislature appoints a bipartisan commission consisting of ten of its own members, the two State Party chairs, and three members \
of the public.  This comission recommends a set of plans to the legislature, which must enact them with a two-thirds majority in each house, subject to approval by the Governor.<br />\
    If this process fails to result in the adoption of a districting plan at some level, the Supreme Judicial Court has the responsibility and power to enact a plan, subject to all of the same rules and requirements.\
    </p>\
    <br />\
    <h4> In 2011... </h4> <p> Maine's old state law required the legislature to wait until 2013 to draw new districts, and a federal lawsuit was brought to push the timeline earlier.  New congressional districts were adopted by the legislature \
    in 2011 and state legislative districts in 2013.\
    </p>\    
    <h4> Since then... </h4> <p>Maine has amended its Constitution to specifically require that redistricting at all levels be done in 2021 and every ten years after that.\
    </p>\
    <h4> What to Look for in 2020... </h4> <p>Based on population estimates, Maine is not expected to gain or lose any seats in the U.S. House of Representatives following the\
    2020 Census. \
