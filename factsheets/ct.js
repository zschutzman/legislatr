    <h4>The Legislature </h4><p> Connecticut's legislature is called the General Assembly, and it is bicameral with a House of Representatives and a Senate.  Members of both houses are elected to two-year terms in even-numbered\
    years, with no term limits.  In the event of a tied vote in the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor casts the deciding vote. </p>\
    <p> In the current legislative session, Democrats hold 24 of the 36 Senate seats, and Republicans hold 12.  In the House, Democrats hold 91 of the 151 seats, and Republicans hold 60.  All five members of the delegation to the U.S.\
    House of Representatives are Democrats.\
    </p><br />\
    <h4> Rules and Requirements </h4><p> Connecticut's congressional districts must comply with federal equal population and contiguity requirements as well as the Voting Rights Act. \
The State has no additional criteria for drawing its Congressional or Senate districts. \
State House districts must be drawn so as to minimize the number of towns split across multiple districts.\
    </p>\
    <br />\
    <h4> Redistricting Process</h4> <p> Congressional and legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the decennial U.S. Census. \
Connecticut uses the same process to draw both its congressional and legislative districts. The legislature appoints an eight member, bipartisan Reapportionent Committee which draws the new maps. \
If the plans pass a two-thirds vote in both houses of the legislature, they are enacted. \
The governor has no veto power in enacting districting plans.<br />\
    If not, a nine member bipartisan Reapportionment Commission is established. \
Four members are appointed by each party's leaders in the legislature and the ninth is selected by the first eight members of the Commission. The Reapportionment Commission has the power to enact districting plans with a simple majority vote.<br />\
    If the Reapportionment Commission fails to enact a plan, then the Connecticut Supreme Court can either compel the Commission to agree on a plan or draw and enact a map itself.\
    </p>\
    <br />\
    <h4> In 2011... </h4> <p>In the most recent redistricting cycle, the legislature failed to pass plans by a two-thirds majority, so a Reapportionment Commission was formed. \
The Commission unanimously adopted State House and Senate plans, but failed to agree on a set of Congressional districts. \
The Connecticut Supreme Court ordered the appointment of a special master to draw the Congressional districts, and his plan was enacted by the Court.\
    </p>\    
    <h4> Since then... </h4> <p>Connecticut has had no court cases or challenges otherwise to any of its districting plans.\
    </p>\
    <h4> What to Look for in 2020... </h4> <p>Based on population estimates, Connecticut is not expected to gain or lose any seats in the U.S. House of Representatives following the\
    2020 Census. \
